The catalyst for this website was a paper published a few years ago named "Voodoo Correlations in Social Neuroscience". This controversial paper pointed the finger to a number of neuroscientists that were using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging" target="_blank">fMRI</a> as candy and doing monkey business in the process. The paper generated a lot of buzz and created awareness to the fact, that should be well-known, that correlation alone is not causation. After a heated debate the authors renamed the paper to <a href="http://www.edvul.com/pdf/VulHarrisWinkielmanPashler-PPS-2009.pdf">“Puzzlingly high correlations in fMRI studies of emotion, personality, and social cognition”</a>

In the paper the authors said:
<blockquote>We have identified a weather station whose temperature readings predict daily changes in the value of a specific set of stocks with a correlation of r 5 %0.87. For $50, we will provide the list of stocks to any interested reader. That way, you can buy the stocks every morning when the weather station posts a drop in temperature and sell when the temperature goes up.</blockquote>
So we decided to <em>mythbuster-it</em>.
